# odin-restaurant-page

This was a project to create a dynamically rendered restaurant website. The intention was to practice creating modules and using webpack to bundle the project.

# Reflections

The project ended up being straightforward as I spent almost no time on the website design, as I didn't want to practice that. Separating a project into modules makes sense and I think I got the hang of the basics. I understand the benefit of Webpack, but it felt like a lot of effort to configure everything manually. I suspect the next lesson will address that though..
